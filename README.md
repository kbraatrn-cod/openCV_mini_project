# OpenCV Mini Project

This project demonstrates basic image processing operations using **OpenCV** and **Matplotlib** in Python.  
The goal is to practice fundamental computer vision techniques such as grayscale conversion, resizing, text overlay, thresholding, blurring, edge detection, and histogram plotting.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Import and display images
- Convert images to grayscale
- Resize images (e.g., scale down by 4/5)
- Add custom text to images
- Apply **binary thresholding**
- Apply **Gaussian blur**
- Apply **Laplacian gradient** (edge detection)
- Plot the image histogram

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
